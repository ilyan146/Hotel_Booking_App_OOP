# Hotel Booking App using Object-Oriented Programming Paradigm
## This is an ever developing hotel booking app using OOP for progressive class based app development.
A fully functional app that uses datasets to display, verify and book hotels with option for credit card payment.
Every part of this project is done using the OOP paradigm with a goal for effective and efficient feature addition to the app with sample codes which shows how to do the following.

* Import the required database for the hotels, for credit card verifications and payment security verification.
* Create classes for Hotel, ReservationTicket, Spa selection, Credit card verification and credit car security check.
* Include possibility to include PDF ticket generation with Receipt No.:, Name and Price to be shown at hotel when checking in.

## Sample of how the app runs on terminal line.
